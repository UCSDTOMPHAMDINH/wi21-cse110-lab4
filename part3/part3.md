# Part 1
## The Bug
The bug was that num1 and num2 are both strings so that when we create the result it ends up doing concat instead of addition and we end up with a concatanation of num1 and num2 instead of addition.
## The Fix
The fix was to convert num1 and num2 to ints so that when added together we end with a result that is an int and we return that result.
